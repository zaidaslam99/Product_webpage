## QR-Code Snippet

```css
body {
  font-family: var(--ff-base);
  font-weight: var(--fw-regular);
  font-size: 0.875rem;
  color: var(--clr-neutral-400);
  background-color: var(--clr-secondary-200);

  /* for this project only */
  display: grid;
  place-content: center;
  margin: 1rem;
}
```

## Lessons Learned

The first thing that we need to know is that we can declare variables when it comes to the use of CSS and what this allows us to do is then recall the variables so that we can use them as suppose of declaring the value each time. We can change parts of the tag using the format that we see above and here we are changing attributes within the body tag. We are going to be changing aspects such as font-family, font-weight, font-size, color, and background-color. What this does is that it modifies these aspects so that we can get the desired look that we are looking for. The next part we are using to position the content so that it can fall into the place that we want it to.
